# Dungeons and DevOps

Performing GameDay exercises informs a team of how their on-call process functions based on a simulated (or staging environment) incident. We can further these learning by turning them into a text based adventure game. The games can be used as training tools for new engineers joining on-call teams or existing teams assuming on-call responsibilities. It is a fun and interactive way to learn what it's like to be on-call.
